Add Bing Webmaster Tools to the search MCP server, alongside Google.

Nine new tools: seven Bing read tools, `compare_engines` (both engines side by
side for one site and range), and `engine_divergence` (classifies each query as
a Google-specific, Bing-specific, or broad decline — the judgement no
single-engine connector can make). `bing_keyword_research` returns keyword
impression data Google Search Console does not expose at all.

The server moved from `/api/mcp/ga-gsc` to `/api/mcp/search`. The old path
still works; existing client configs need no change.

Bing's `GetQueryStats` accepts no date parameter, so the two tools window it
differently and each says so in its output: `compare_engines` reports the Bing
side as an unwindowed aggregate, while `engine_divergence` fetches once and
buckets rows locally on each row's own date. Where an engine cannot answer, the
affected rows report `insufficient_data` rather than zero clicks.

Positions are normalized at the client boundary: Bing sends `-1` for "no
position" on zero-click rows, which is now `null` rather than a number that
reads as a real ranking.

Read-only: no Bing write method is called anywhere.
