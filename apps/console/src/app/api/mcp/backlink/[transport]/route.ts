/**
 * Backlink MCP server, mounted as a Next.js App Router route handler.
 *
 * Built from the re-homed tool registry in `@/mcp/backlink/server` via the Vercel
 * `mcp-handler` adapter. A per-caller distributed rate-limit gate runs before the
 * transport hand-off (reusing `@advance-labs/storage`'s limiter via `@/mcp/shared`); a
 * second, finer scrape limiter inside the live HTTP client throttles outbound GETs
 * to the free sources (DuckDuckGo, Wayback, CommonCrawl).
 *
 * BYOK: `generate_outreach_email` takes the LLM API key as a request-scoped tool
 * argument — keys are never read from the environment, persisted, or logged.
 *
 * Node runtime: the tools scrape pages and call upstream APIs over the network.
*
 * ROUTE SHAPE: this file MUST live under a `[transport]` segment. `mcp-handler`
 * derives its endpoints from `basePath` as `${basePath}/mcp`, `${basePath}/sse` and
 * `${basePath}/message`, then compares the request pathname against them. Mounted
 * directly at the basePath it answers every request with its own plain-text
 * "Not found" — a 404 that looks like a routing bug and is not. The dynamic segment
 * is what makes those transport paths exist. Clients connect to `<basePath>/mcp`.
