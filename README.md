## What is AEO?

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** is the practice of structuring your content so that AI assistants — ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini — cite your site when answering questions in your domain. Traditional SEO gets you ranked on the blue-link results page. AEO gets you *quoted* in the AI answer.

As AI-powered search becomes the default discovery layer, AEO is the new SEO.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install individual packages
npm install @aeo/crawler @aeo/html-parser @aeo/scoring

# Crawl a site and score every page
import { crawl } from '@aeo/crawler'
import { parseHtml } from '@aeo/html-parser'
import { scorePage } from '@aeo/scoring'

const pages = await crawl('https://example.com')
for (const page of pages) {
  const parsed = parseHtml(page.html)
  const score = scorePage(parsed)
  console.log(page.url, score.total, score.rules)
}
```

## Why AEO?

When a user asks ChatGPT "what is the best tool for X?", the answer comes from indexed content that AI models trust — not from ad-auction bidding. The trust signals for AI citation are:

- **Structured data** (JSON-LD `Organization`, `FAQPage`, `HowTo`)
- **`llms.txt`** — the AI equivalent of `robots.txt`
- **Canonical, server-rendered HTML** — AI crawlers prefer static content
- **Topical authority** — consistent, in-depth coverage of a topic

AEO Toolkit automates auditing all of these.

## Made by Advance Labs

AEO Toolkit is built and maintained by **[Advance Labs Inc.](https://advancelabs.dev)** — a software studio building [Creatin](https://www.creatin.ca), [Cartrix](https://www.cartrix.live), and this toolkit.

This project dogfoods its own tooling: `advancelabs.dev` ships with `llms.txt`, JSON-LD Organization schema, SSG-rendered pages, and canonical URLs — all patterns the scoring engine teaches.
