 * Graduated-autonomy gate (pure) — spec §0.2.

 * compliance risk — that is where the "magic" is). Every genuinely risky surface — `link-outreach`
 * today, marketplace/community later — is ALWAYS human-gated and can never auto-execute.
 *
 * Pure and total: no clock, no I/O. The console execution layer consults this before publishing.
