/**
 * @advance-labs/backlinks — a free-source backlink engine.
 *
 * Provider adapters over the public, no-key sources (DuckDuckGo HTML search,
 * CommonCrawl's URL index, the Wayback Machine CDX API) plus pure contact
 * extraction, an injectable HTTP seam (with a rate-limited decorator), and a
 * builder that assembles those signals into a sampled, layered backlink graph.
 *
 * Every adapter routes network I/O through the injectable {@link HttpClient} and
 * degrades gracefully (failures become `warnings[]`, never throws), so consumers
 * and tests stay network-free.
